Netflix Movie Data Analysis Project

Netflix is renowned for its innovative use of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML), particularly in building powerful recommendation systems that understand and anticipate customer behavior and viewing patterns.

In this project, I took on the role of a data analyst in a data-driven environment, working with a dataset containing information on over 9,000 Netflix movies. The goal was to extract meaningful insights to support data-informed business decisions.

##Tools & Technologies Used:

* **Python** – Primary programming language for data analysis
* **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation, cleaning, and exploration
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization and trend identification

##Key Insights Derived:

* **Most Frequent Genre**: Identified the most commonly occurring genre among Netflix movie releases.
* **Highest Average Rating**: Discovered the movie with the highest average vote (`vote_avg`) and highlighted its genre.
* **Most Popular Movie**: Analyzed the movie with the highest popularity score, along with its genre.
* **Least Popular Movie**: Identified the movie with the lowest popularity and examined its genre.

This analysis provides valuable insights into content performance and audience preferences, which can be leveraged to enhance recommendation algorithms, guide content strategy, and improve user engagement on the platform.
